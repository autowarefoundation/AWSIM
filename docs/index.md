[AWSIM Labs](https://github.com/autowarefoundation/AWSIM) is currently being developed under the [Autoware Labs](https://github.com/orgs/autowarefoundation/discussions/4550) initiative. Main purpose of this fork is to provide faster implementation of features needed by the users of the AWSIM while also ensuring a high-performance simulation environment for the [Autoware](https://github.com/autowarefoundation/autoware).

This is a fork of [TIER IV's AWSIM](https://github.com/tier4/AWSIM).

### Features

- Many predefined components included (Vehicle dynamic models, Sensor models, Environment configuration, ROS2 communication, etc)
- Support for Ubuntu 22.04 and windows10/11
- ROS2 native communication (humble)
- [Open sourced](https://autowarefoundation.com/autowarefoundation/AWSIM)
- Made with [Unity](https://unity.com/)
